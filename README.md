Zerseher
========

Remake of "Zerseher" by Joachim Sauter in Processing, using the Eye Tribe tracker.

In the **code** folder of this project, you will notice **EyeTribe.jar**. 

##Here is how to make EyeTribe.jar yourself. 

1. Get the latest version of tet-java-client [here](https://github.com/EyeTribe/tet-java-client).

2. Open Eclipse, and create a Java Project called EyeTribe. 

3. Copy the contents of tet-java-client to the EyeTribe directory in your Eclipse workspace folder. 

4. In Eclipse, export the project as a .jar by going to File -> Export, and choosing **JAR file** in the Java folder.
